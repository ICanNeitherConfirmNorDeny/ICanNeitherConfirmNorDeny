Hi, I can neither confirm nor deny that I am ICanNeitherConfirmNorDeny.

I have many interests ranging from retro systems and programs to modern crap.
In my spare time, I like looking for once useful tools and redesign them to work.
I like to tinker a bit with them and either make them break or make them work better.

Find my stuff interesting and/or useful in any way? Feel free to buy me a beer.
